* This directory will include general functions that
  don't have to be React specific.

- For instance you might have files that do certain
  functions such as capitalizing all letters in a
  string.

- Keep in mind, that things written inside this
  directory might have a similar use to npm packages
  you install. If you would use it like a third party
  library put it in here.
