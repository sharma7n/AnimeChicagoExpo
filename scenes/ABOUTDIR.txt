* This is the genesis of the app. The main material.

- The app is made up of a series of
  routes/screens/scenes.

- Every sub directory will have a container file. The
  job of the container file is to fetch and manage our
  data for the specific route. An example file is
  DetailsContainer.js

- There will also be a component file named after the
  directory. Such as Details.js which will be a
  component that is the view side of things for the
  route.
